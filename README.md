# Lorenz-Attractor
A program for my Modeling and Simulation class that models a Lorenz Attractor.

# Instructions:
You are going to need a properly running computer with at least 8GB of Ram. 
Installs of Required Software/Libraries: SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, and mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.

Inside the .zip file, you will find a folder labeled project5. Open this folder and then open the folder Jwhitebread_project5.
Inside that folder you should find the Jwhitebread_project5.py file.

To run the program, simply copy and paste the code from my Jwhitebread_project5.py file into a new pycharm python project and then press run. 

There will be a series of graphs that pop up, 3 sets of 4 graphs. Once done with a graph, simply press the x in the corner to go to the next.
The first graph of each set will be the 3-D butterfly model.
The second graph will be a 2-D graph of t and x.
The third graph will be a 2-D graph of t and y.
The fourth graph will be a 2-D graph of t and z.
